# S-Place

> A Javascript Game Inspired by Stuff

<br> 

**Work in progress!**

A 2D shooter game. Play as a geometric shape that uses the power of exploding gunpowder 
to make your way through the dangerous lands of S-Place. Explore towns, talk to folks, 
and gain power and allies to reach your goal. This game was built on a custom game engine 
written in vanilla Javascript (just for fun!).

Powered by `boggersJS`.

<p align="center"><img height="110" src="boggersJS/docs/assets/boggers-logo.png"></p>

The engine, `boggersJS`, is supposed to be an improvement over the Python game engine I
made for my previous game, `DANGERDice`. One of the biggest improvements was implementing
fixed timesteps to ensure consistency no matter what type of fancy monitor you play on.
Why make another engine? Because they're just fun to write and put together!

# Build Instructions

There would be build instructions if I were to write this game engine in ReactJS or some
other JavaScript framework, but that didn't happen. You can play it directly on the web.

## Required Dependencies

This game requires a browser to play on. The fact that you can read this `README` means
you can run this game. Get to it!
